The Untitle.ipynb notebook runs the lstm model with glove feature vectors on the guardian dataset- use the lstm_glove.h5 model.

We find the p@5 values for top5 sentences of each article.

The other notebooks according to their names are for training the different sets of models with different feature vectors on the mpqa/yahoo dataset. Requires glove.6B vectors readily available. Also need the stanford parser and pos tagger which are also openly available.
